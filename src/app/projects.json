For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on). The enemy character only has Counter Attack Power. Unlike the player's Attack Points, Counter Attack Power never changes. No characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points. A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an enemy with low Counter Attack Power. This will allow them to grind Attack Power and to take on enemies before they lose all of their Health Points. The challenge comes from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player.",
